Strong tools for data manipulation and analysis are offered by NumPy. It is effective for jobs like data cleaning, data transformation, and data aggregation because of its capacity to handle big arrays and carry out vectorised operations. It is simple to slice, resize, and concatenate NumPy arrays to carry out different data manipulation operations.
